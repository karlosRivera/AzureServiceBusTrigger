# AzureServiceBusTrigger
Using the long-polling support and the onMessage event within the Azure Service Bus libraries, create an event-based trigger which will react on new messages being received on a queue or a subscription. Combining this with HTTP WebHook support enables the solution to run as an Azure Web Site, and post received message info to a callback URL, such as the one available via Azure Logic Apps WebHook triggers.
